# A first approach to Image Captioning with Neural Networks
A neural network who take images as input and generates caption, following the Encoder-Decoder approach.
The neural network created is made of two different NN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the former for extract features from image, to represent them, the latter to actual predict the caption, word by word.
The jupiter notebook are to showing the code, they were extrapolated from a Google Colab project so they need to be fixed (since there is no dataset loaded, on github, most of the jypiter wont work, also in the code there are specific paths).

A report file is attached, if you are interested go ahead and take a look at the report.pdf file.
